<p>I work as a Geospatial Analyst with specialties in web based development, production mapping, business analytics, Geospatial Intelligence, Emergency Management, and custom tools scripting. I would be happy to share my knowledge and experience to help anyone who needs to fortify their organization.

I have served my country and local community for over 15 years. I have a commitment to the Greater Middle TN area to use my skills for helping the movers, shakers, and decisions makers make our communities a great place to live and work. </p>

<p>I am a hard working, self-motivated team member that thrives in chaotic environments. The greater the challenge the better my performance.</p>
